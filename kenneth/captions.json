(Source: ICU RN) - Utilize all the resources possible in getting moving again, using physical and occupational therapy. Also, be patient with yourself in this time, minute by minute, day by day. It may take time to see progress, but it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not a race. - Do your coughing and deep breathing exercises and use the Incentive Spirometer. Sometimes I suggest doing it during commercial breaks if you\u2019re watching TV or at least several times a day. Use a pillow to brace your coughs (hugging them as you cough) to try to decrease the pain. - Find a healthy balance of medical and non-medical interventions for pain and/or anxiety. Medications can be very beneficial, but there\u2019s also a lot of studies showing many non-drug\u2019s work just as well/almost as well, without nearly as many of the side effects. (Also, several of the medications can cause \u2018hangover\u2019 type effects and small withdrawal symptoms in a very short time.). I often suggest friends & family visits, card games/board games/video games (if you can hook it up nearby, even better). Music is also shown to help with pain, alleviate anxiety, can help with bad dreams. Acupuncture can be beneficial for some people. Even use of some essential oils can alleviate anxiety for others. Ice periodically, anti-inflammatory\u2019s work great, exercise as prescribed. Laughter is always excellent. - I know there\u2019s highly specific routines and protocols regarding almost everything post-transplant, and it\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve worked in that area. I\u2019ll leave those details to the experts caring for you now! - It can be normal to experience anxiety and depression following the operation. Some of the medications and your bodies response to everything can be overwhelming. It is normal to maybe have bad dreams or trouble sleeping. It\u2019s okay to talk about these things or give yourself some time to re-acclimate, but don\u2019t let it consume you. There\u2019s several resources and people willing to help. Just a few things off the top of my head and wanted to add anything positive to help. Take care during your recovery!!",

Not only does it look super artificial, the brightness of the foreground also distracts from the starlight. With this impressive star shot, you already have more than you need (maybe reduce the resolution a bit to hide minor issues). When I think EarthPorn, I don't think of Photoshop-Porn, I think of shots that reflect a mood in nature, so they should at least look reasonably natural."
    ],
    [
        "I will comment on the star part since this is what i know something about. You seem to have some halos around the brighter start, where you using a filter in front of the lens? They can both mess with the color balance and give some reflections. The color balance of the stars is way off, you have too much blue and purple in there. An easy fix in post processing is to set the white point on a main sequence star, it will have the same color as the sun, it will be white/yellowish. To fix the sky color, you need to set the grey point to an empty piece of sky. Use the color sampler tool in Photoshop, set it to minimum 5x5 and then adjust the RGB values so the have the same value. You might need to select several samples of the sky because it can vary in color and then try to find the best median values for each point, it can be a balancing act. Your focus is also a bit off. If you are using only a camera and no software the best method is focusing using live view. Zoom in on a bright star and then adjust the focus so the star is as small as possible with no discoloration. At f1.4 you will have a very narrow focus range so it will require some patience and very small focus adjustments. Consider stepping down the lens a little to improve the corners. Keep at it, it is a learning process and it is hard to master. Good luck with your next attempt :)",

For starters, we don't really know precisely the cause of depression (and almost certainly there are many different causes). Second, there has been fairly limited success in showing specific causal connections between treatments of depression and relief of depression. But what we do know is that BOTH medications (i.e. attempts to modify your \"chemistry\") and cognitive behavioural therapy have been credited with some cases of improvement and that there is a statistically significant improvement to doing both. So your depression might be \"chemistry\" but it might also be related to your character. It could even be (and likely is) a combination of these factors.",

October 1845 My little sister has been missing for two days and I have wandered into the dark oak forests north of our village, in hopes to at least find her body. No matter which creature mauled her. To at least hold her in my arms, one last time, is my only wish. The forest seems so cold and unwelcoming in autumn, as if it lies in its dying bed, exiling every living being within itself. An hour before sunset i observed an eerie fog coming from south which spread itself around and on-top of the forest its movements were like as of a single entity, it seemed like that _the fog itself_ was looking for something. I was, weirdly enough, captivated by the way _the fog moved_ . The moment i saw ***it*** i stood there, in terror not able to move for what seemed like eternity,before i bolted back to the village On my bolt back home i felt grate shame, for being such a coward but to keep a more lighter tone for the ending, I ran into my sister\u201d \u201cIs this why we are not allowed to go into the forest in the north Mr. Mischa?\u201d \u201cYou can go to the forest, just stay away from the everlasting fog, we don\u2019t know what the fog-walker is capable of doing, now go and play with the others Fjodora\u201d ^^",

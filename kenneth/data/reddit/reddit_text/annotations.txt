d86s5n.jpg#1	Thanks for the new wallpaper my guy
d86s5n.jpg#2	There no neon church sign? 😉
d86s5n.jpg#3	It's a good shot. Natural light photography at night is the only way to go, when you can get it. my only critique would be to work on composition, study it, and if you can't get it in camera, get it in post. IMO, the majority of memorable photos that you see are the result of good composition and while it can happen by accident, you can make it happen by knowing how to set up the shot.
d86s5n.jpg#4	looks good! keep at it c:
d8c5ar.jpg#0	Stories like these convince me that the majority of people who join radical groups join because they either feel lonely or invisible and they desire to belong to something... anything.
d8c5ar.jpg#1	It's crazy how much fear, weight and terror that costume holds when you understand the context. If you had no idea where it was from, it just looks like a shitty half homemade halloween costume.
d8c5ar.jpg#2	Keep up the good work. Educate the hate out of them.
d8c5ar.jpg#3	Everyone should listen to the episode of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast about Thresholds to understand how a black man befriending white supremacists can actually help them to justify future racist behavior.

d81s6z.jpg#2	Is it me, or are there no positive pics of the current president?? We've seen hundreds of pics showing the Obamas in everyday life depicted as normal folks to look up to and respect. We've seen no pics of the current president depicted as a normal person. Why?
d81s6z.jpg#3	Republican here, and never thought I would say this, but I do miss that guy. Not because I agreed with most of his policies or positions (I didn't), but because he carried himself like a President. He was *Presidential.* Same with his predecessor (GWB). Regardless of how you feel about President Trump's policies, his incessant use of and bizarre postings on Twitter are embarrassing.
d81s6z.jpg#4	I may not have agreed with the guy politically, but the one thing about President Obama that I really enjoyed was his obvious and very public affection for his wife. It was like he was showing the world "this is what a partnership is all about", something I think the modern world has forgotten about.

d881eb.jpg#3	So carfentanil is the best one? I'm confused. Which one is the best?
d881eb.jpg#4	Never heard of carfentanil. Must be good shit. Nobody speaks about it

d7xiud.jpg#1	[deleted] ? Why?
d7xiud.jpg#2	I’ll never understand why people go through such lengths just for internet Karma. Maybe I’m too old lmao.
d7xiud.jpg#3	Looks like best way to get karma in this subreddit is : 1 - picture of “myself” that is actually someone else because by the time I am busted the karma is already mine 2 - adding context, because without context the pic has ABSOLUTELY no substance. Ensuring context is someone dying or whatever people “like” in real life and can relate. 3 - Make sure to do an “update” post so can double dip karma.
d7xiud.jpg#4	Thought I deleted Facebook. Weird.

d8ecub.jpg#4	She’s gorgeous!
d8dxxp.jpg#0	She'd make a better president than that buffoon. That sounds obvious but she understands vastly more about leadership at 16 than he does at 70. Hell, he doesn't even have leadership over his diet.
d8dxxp.jpg#1	He is too much of a pussy to look at her.
d8dxxp.jpg#2	Red flag her.

d7yjdg.jpg#1	No, they don’t play this year. Palace aren’t in the champions league.
d7yjdg.jpg#2	My friend took me there this July during the heatwave. There was an exhibit of sculptures inside. That was the only cool thing about my experience. Being inside that thing in 35° heat isn’t fun. The pond outside of it with turtles and ducks were a nice touch though.
d7yjdg.jpg#3	This is a photo taken of a temporary art installation in this space. It is real but doesn't usually/currently look like this. "To Breathe – A Mirror Woman is Kimsooja’s 2006 site-specific installation for the Palacio de Cristal in Madrid, Spain. To expand and unite the architectural structure of the space, Kimsooja had the whole floor tiled in mirrors. She then covers the vault and the entire glass surface of the palace with a translucent diffraction film. When outside light filters through the glass and reflects off the film, it creates a rainbow spectrum that is mirrored in every part of the atrium."

d869wy.jpg#0	I was raised by a single mother with the help of my grandparents (from my mother's side). Gabriel, my stepfather, was the only man I could truly call 'dad'. I owe him a lot, although I was already an adult when he married my mother - he's been a father, an educator and most importantly a friend to me. I'll forever miss him and cherish every moment we spent together. I've learned so much from him in the small window of time we've both been on this Earth together... He was and will forever be one of the greatest people I'll ever meet. Edit: [The song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmELS03_4So) I was listening to when I found out he'd passed away. Such a beautiful song still.
d869wy.jpg#1	Dude he could be the white Nick Fury! Pretty badass
d869wy.jpg#2	Great shots to remember him by! Stay strong!
d869wy.jpg#3	Wait, he smokes? My dad left 30 years ago for a pack of smokes, and never returned
d869wy.jpg#4	Thank you for sharing these. What a wonderful tribute to someone who was important to you! Great quality shots by the way, you have a real talent there.

d8daf7.jpg#1	Isn’t an aurora created by the reflection of moonlight on ice that then has light scatter across the sky and is displayed because of that and isn’t there not any ice on Jupiter or Saturn meaning there couldn’t be an aurora or am I stupid
d8daf7.jpg#2	Looks like mass effect 3 and the 3 endings you get from it.

d7yynf.jpg#1	By the way, if you toss a cigarette butt on the ground, that's the same thing. Disgusting behavior.
d7yynf.jpg#2	If you check off all of the above you don’t have to check off the rest.
d7yynf.jpg#3	The sign he's in the process of affixing to the bottom reads "Supported by Duke Energy", a company in flagrant breach of multiple environmental regulations and infamous for a multi million dollar law suit over contaminating rivers with coal ash.

d7qenq.jpg#0	This is what my family did with my grandpa died but instead they turned the shirts into teddy bears for the grandkids.
d7qenq.jpg#1	My grandpa was a super badass ww2 veteran, but boy did he love to knit and crochet. Years and years later after he has passed, I still have the little pillows and rugs he’d make me as gifts for the holidays. As an ungrateful teenager when I’d get things like that I’d roll my eyes and scoff, but years later I get it now, and I’m glad he did too.
d7qenq.jpg#2	finally, a way to sleep with my grandpa every night again
d7qenq.jpg#3	I have a very similar one that belonged to my little brother. He passed away last year at 39 from complications of diabetes. The shirt used was his favorite flannel and next to it is a small framed photo of him with a big smile on his face, wearing that same flannel. It was made by a friend of the family and is the most heartfelt gift I have ever received.
d7qenq.jpg#4	My uncle had a similar one made but the sleeve is still attached on one side so it's a hug from grandpa too.
d8bg49.jpg#0	Man this school sounds pretty okay
d8bg49.jpg#1	This sign says "shoot teachers first".
d8bg49.jpg#2	Hopefully those armed staff are braver than many of the police who have failed to intervene in school shootings. Oh, but the sign will prevent any violence. My bad, I forgot.
d8bg49.jpg#3	The great part, is potentially no one is armed. Some slob looking to make a name for themselves with a mass shooting is going to look for an easy target. This sign could potentially be saving lives, and no one would know. ... also... shouldn't it be "MAY" be legally armed?
d8bg49.jpg#4	This sign reminds me of the final battle at Hogwarts.

d88fh4.jpg#0	I mean good for her. Like she saw something that she didn't like and she's trying to change the world. But I don't know if yelling at people is going to get her point across.
d88fh4.jpg#1	Um, what are they going to do? Force some kind of legislation? "YES" you would say. On who? "EVERYONE!" So what kind of meaningful changes would you like to see. "NO CARBON EMISSIONS!" How can we do that without crippling not only our own, but everyone's economy. "JUST DO IT!" K so we do it. All non carbon neutral power sources are shut down. Food stops being produced and shipped. Each household maybe gets a couple hours of power everyday. Billions of people (probably) starve or die of exposure. "GOOD WE'RE KILLING THE EARTH ANYWAYS". But lets say.. we innovate and can slowly but surely fix our problem without causing havoc. Kind of like what we have been doing. The USA is getting better along with most 1st world countries. "BUT IT'S TOO LATE!" you say. Yes, it's too late, and we'll live with the consequences. But we'll live.
d88fh4.jpg#2	Not leaving much room for cooperation, kid. Just alienating people in power that could potentially help
d88fh4.jpg#3	Good. They should be yelled at, it's only embarrassing that we had to have a child do it.

d89vg2.jpg#3	I’m surprised he’s got the strength to turn the wheel. Looks like a hefty machine and no power steering
d89vg2.jpg#4	This week at Hot Rod’s Drag Week, a guy drove a 1919 Franklin Pierce to the whole event. 5 days of drag racing at 4 different tracks. About 800 miles of road driving and 5 hits on the track. I think his best pass was 30 seconds and change at 47 mph. He made the very first pass every morning at 0800 hours then headed out the gate on his way to the next track. And he certainly wasn’t the first to make it through all the checkpoints! But he got it done. They said his Grandpappy was the original owner of the car, and he also competed I. The “lap of America” this year which included 8,000 miles on the road. It was pretty awesome!

d7rhpq.jpg#3	Paper is recyclable... The paper industry also is pretty good at self sustaining itself. I don't understand these people, it's like they want to go back in progress... It's the same with the people who want to replace recyclable plastic straws with paper straws which currently can't be recycled (Google it, this is real) Also use less paper is in complete opposition to 'make paper straws' Edit: source on non recyclable straws https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49234054

d89b7l.jpg#2	Was it really turned into a walking track? or is that just you saying that is what it has become unintentionally because all you see is people walking around and no stores?
d89b7l.jpg#3	I know this mall! I haven’t been to it in years because I moved. I can not believe what i see in this picture right now. When i was a kid like 15 years ago, this mall would always be full of people everyday. So sad to see it like this now..
d89b7l.jpg#4	This looks like regency mall, but probably every mall made in the 80s/90s looks about the same

d866a1.jpg#4	Pretty pessimistic here, but it’s been done before. It’s original because each piece of wood is different. Looks really nice though, but soon he should do some big woodworking and make tikis with or something. Tell him too keep up the hobby though.
d82yfj.jpg#0	A lot of these frog pictures are dead frogs that have been pinned in place and photographed - That kind of ruins the sweetness for me.
d82yfj.jpg#1	Why does this frog have a frog face on its belly. Is that like a frog Kuato?
d82yfj.jpg#2	Why does this frog belly resemble my body
d82yfj.jpg#3	Ok thats adorable.

d7xato.jpg#1	For those concerned about harmful blue-green algae, I’ve already checked for it. Very good advice though. Those stories are terrifying. The water actually only looks blue in this picture because I dyed it today to cut down on weeds. Safe for humans, dogs, and fish. But there’s no harmful blue-green algae in here. He’s been playing in the pond for over a week now and loves it. Thanks for the concern and it _is_ great advice!

d87agd.jpg#0	Ha. I drove by this CFA this morning on the way to work and didn't notice.
d87agd.jpg#1	Naw what if you bought it Saturday night and ate it in the morning. They're just telling you it's a great idea any day to eat it.
d87agd.jpg#2	Chick-fil-a on Sundays: Great Idea, terrible execution
d87agd.jpg#3	Why did they even decide to name a fast food place that? Its a horrible name. Its spelled ridiculously and sounds weirdly sexual. Most people wouldn't even pronounce it the way they want you to without having heard it beforehand. It looks much more like its pronounced 'chickfiller'.
d87agd.jpg#4	They aren’t wrong. It is still a great idea on sundays.
d7yc1h.jpg#0	Salt, pepper, dash of rosemary. Braise over low heat for 3-4 hours.
d7yc1h.jpg#1	Congratulations! And I’m not sure how far along in to the recovery process you are, but I wanted to offer a few tips. (Source: ICU RN) - Utilize all the resources possible in getting moving again, using physical and occupational therapy. Also, be patient with yourself in this time, minute by minute, day by day. It may take time to see progress, but it’s okay. It’s not a race. - Do your coughing and deep breathing exercises and use the Incentive Spirometer. Sometimes I suggest doing it during commercial breaks if you’re watching TV or at least several times a day. Use a pillow to brace your coughs (hugging them as you cough) to try to decrease the pain. - Find a healthy balance of medical and non-medical interventions for pain and/or anxiety. Medications can be very beneficial, but there’s also a lot of studies showing many non-drug’s work just as well/almost as well, without nearly as many of the side effects. (Also, several of the medications can cause ‘hangover’ type effects and small withdrawal symptoms in a very short time.). I often suggest friends & family visits, card games/board games/video games (if you can hook it up nearby, even better). Music is also shown to help with pain, alleviate anxiety, can help with bad dreams. Acupuncture can be beneficial for some people. Even use of some essential oils can alleviate anxiety for others. Ice periodically, anti-inflammatory’s work great, exercise as prescribed. Laughter is always excellent. - I know there’s highly specific routines and protocols regarding almost everything post-transplant, and it’s been a few years since I’ve worked in that area. I’ll leave those details to the experts caring for you now! - It can be normal to experience anxiety and depression following the operation. Some of the medications and your bodies response to everything can be overwhelming. It is normal to maybe have bad dreams or trouble sleeping. It’s okay to talk about these things or give yourself some time to re-acclimate, but don’t let it consume you. There’s several resources and people willing to help. Just a few things off the top of my head and wanted to add anything positive to help. Take care during your recovery!!
d7yc1h.jpg#2	Congratulations! Hope you’re healing well. PS: might want to mark this NSFW
d7yc1h.jpg#3	That looks like a real pain in the ass to install lol.

d88fhw.jpg#1	God damn, that motherfucker can see into the future.
d88fhw.jpg#2	This terrifies me
d88fhw.jpg#3	I feel it is always looking at me.
d88fhw.jpg#4	Is it supposed to have human eyes? What else could it possibly have other than fish eyes?
d7rggp.jpg#0	You did it wrong. You're supposed to say "I don't know if trash tag is still a thing. Lets keep it going!"
d7rggp.jpg#1	Not to defend people for littering, but I can see how one might lose a fishing hook and not be able to find it. Of course, they spent an afternoon and found 10, so it can't be that hard. But I guess what I'm saying is I understand the fishing hooks more than the rest of the lot, as it's something you could drop and have no idea you've lost it.
d7rggp.jpg#2	Is this Revere beach? I haven't been there in years because of how much people litter there.
d7rggp.jpg#3	This picture makes me want to litter.

d7yhib.jpg#0	I climbed to the top of Sydney Harbor Bridge when I studied abroad there in 2016. It's an absolutely gorgeous view. Can't believe they have sand storms there
d7yhib.jpg#1	A buddy of mine that lives in Sydney sent me pictures from that event. It was scary looking. Luna Park looked like something out of hell.
d7yhib.jpg#2	Looks like a still from Blade Runner: 2049
d7yhib.jpg#3	I remember going to work over the bridge that day in the train. Felt like I was going to work at the Pyramid Mines from Total Recall. I also vaguely remember someone photoshopping a giant Godzilla behind the bridge in one of those pictures. Ah here it is :) [https://live.staticflickr.com/3476/3946946286\_40825215df\_b.jpg](https://live.staticflickr.com/3476/3946946286_40825215df_b.jpg)

d7vkts.jpg#0	Congrats on being rich
d7vkts.jpg#1	Are you a Rothschild? That’s not a normal people wedding.
d7vkts.jpg#2	Would not have been married in the actual library - there’s tourists buzzing about in the background. You can get married in the chapel though but there are criteria. I was part of a wedding there, it’s beautiful very much like Protestant churches with side facing pews to the aisle. Photos outside the chapel become a draw for tourists. I’d say I’m in a few holiday snaps! Weddings in College Chapel Application to marry in the College Chapel is only considered when at least one partner is: A part-time or full-time member of the College staff, or A student enrolled in a DEGREE course in Trinity College, or A graduate who received a DEGREE from the University of Dublin, having completed the course of study in Trinity College The Trinity College Chapel is a Christian Chapel, and only Christian weddings may take place there. The marriage ceremony has to be conducted by an ordained minister of the mainstream Christian Churches.
d7vkts.jpg#3	Just visited this library over the summer. Crazy crowded but gorgeous...and the book smell was out of this world.
d7vkts.jpg#4	I too have little money.....

d88buz.jpg#0	Or instead of stopping with your red bull and taking an all important pic, to then sit on your ass and complain about it to all your social media couch-protestors, GO fix it. Get some soil, some grass seed, some water...go out every day and water it, weed it, plant flowers once it grows. You talk about "who" did it... All I see is you NOT doing anything....
d88buz.jpg#1	Says the guy holding a single use drink can...
d88buz.jpg#2	You're drinking a can of RedBull. Nothing is more fake when it comes to communicating integrity.
d88buz.jpg#3	Its probably there for the Doggos. So they have a little spot to do their business, that isn't a part of the concrete jungle. Buddy there's tons of beauty in nature, gotta get out of that shitty city to see it. Also, do yourself a favor, stop drinking energy drinks. Stuff eats your guts from the inside out.

d7yflm.jpg#4	100% fake (i.e. not a real ad/ad juxtaposition but either a digital edit or an artist's physical placement). But still kind of funny.

d7fmls.jpg#3	I did this for my kids once. They are total rock nerds like me. We spent a whole day finding only 8 of the coolest rocks. Started out with like a hundred and whittled them down. Then you can epoxy some little rubberized neodymium magnets on the back and let me tell you that is a great birthday present. I polycoated the rocks so they looked cool, Stuck the magnets on, and they hold a bunch of the things on our fridge years later.
d7fmls.jpg#4	Not dumb! Source: Regularly scavenge for colorful rocks.
d81t48.jpg#0	You're your own worst critic. I never learned how to do art because I thought everything I did looked horrible and would give up. The sun conure looks great!!

d81t48.jpg#3	Don't change it, looks great!

d7hsui.jpg#0	I just realized how much more storage space tall people have. Not only could I not reach that brush on the top of the shelf, but I'd never even know it was there. I wonder how much stuff my husband is hiding from me just inches above my head?
d7hsui.jpg#1	Jesus. How tall are you?
d7hsui.jpg#2	I would love to have that struggle
d7hsui.jpg#3	You look like Spiderman (Toby McGuire) if he were bitten by a daddy long legs.

d7kjsx.jpg#2	I'm half Dutch (born and raised), half Egyptian. Egypt will always have a place in my heart. I know that that sisi did you all wrong. Please keep me posted. Last time I went to Egypt, I saw the square and people told me that, with a protests, they could close the square and shoot everybody. So I really hope that you are all ok, that you will fight this injustice and make Egypt the beautiful county it once was. Edit: is there something people can do to help the citizens from overseas?

d80mza.jpg#3	If it works, it's a Fluke. This was a line in an SF series about a company of misfit Space Legion (Marines). Fluke was a respected manufacturer of equipment, owned by [Captain Jester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phule%27s_Company_\(series\)).

d7brl6.jpg#1	It finally gets to him and hes like... " who the fuck is this Bernie guy that everyone seems to associated me with."
d7brl6.jpg#2	" For the last time! I'm not Bernie!"
d7brl6.jpg#3	Did they also give him a throat lozenge? Jokes aside, this made me smile a bit. It's good to see people genuinely respecting one another and not crumpling up the note like jerk
d7brl6.jpg#4	Nitpicky, but it looks like he's in first class, not coach. Looks like an Embraer regional jet which is barely wide enough for 4 seats, so they have the weird asymmetrical layout at the front (1 seat on the left, 2 on the right) for their first class. edit: lots of people seem to be interpreting my post as being political or opinionated. It isn't. It's just a statement that the post title says coach and he's sitting in first. I am not passing any judgement one way or another here. edit2: Oh my god, I do not have a political agenda here, I'm just pointing out that *he's visibly sitting in the fucking first class cabin*. Some of the replies I've gotten here are absolutely embarrassing - I've been insulted, called a Russian bot, been thrown all sorts of excuses for why he might be sitting there (I do not give a shit whether he's in first or in the cargo hold). If I weren't a filthy immigrant who who can't vote I'd probably vote Bernie, but some of you are so fucking obnoxious that you're certainly disenfranchising potential Bernie voters so grow the fuck up because you are embarrassing your own cause.

d5us0y.jpg#4	Man I wish we would get some rain here. Also, I would totally buy this as a print and hang it in my bathroom.
d90kd9.jpg#0	I would really like to go to a place like that right now.
d90kd9.jpg#1	Hey everyone. I shot this back in 2013 when visiting Yosemite for the first time, not too long after getting into photography. Photography is something that has changed my life, helping me battle through depression and allowing me to once again see light in an often dark world. If you’re struggling to cope, just know there’s always hope and you’re not alone. Don’t give up! One day, one hour at a time. If you like my work, I’d appreciate your following on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/williampatino_photography/?hl=en) Thanks! Edit: settings from memory were f/16 iso 100 and no idea what the shutter speed was. Would’ve been close to 1 second. A faster exposure was also needed for the sky and the two were blended together. Shot on a canon 5dii.
d90kd9.jpg#2	Looks like the inside of Bob Ross' imagination
d90kd9.jpg#3	Amazing..looks so peaceful. Would want to camp over there.
d90kd9.jpg#4	Stunning. Never been to America, but if I ever visited, Yosemite would be on my list.
d8z301.jpg#0	Firstly, apologies as this picture not PURE EarthPorn. There is a building that can be seen in the picture, the Gergeti Trinity Church. Though it is largely hidden in the shadows, so I figured it would be fine. This picture was taken from a hotel in Stephantsminda, a small village and resort town in Georgia, near the border with Russia. Georgia is a country that is rapidly gaining popularity in the world of tourism and if it wasn't on your radar before, I strongly suggest you start to look into a trip here. For many reasons, this country is one of my favourite i've ever been to. If you're keen to see more, i'll regularly be posting images of Georgia and beyond on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ahpflaum/) and [Website](https://www.alexhpflaum.com/) Cheers!

d8w66s.jpg#0	I shot the foreground with the 16-35mm f4 Canon lens. The sky was shot with the 105mm Sigma Art, many shots stitched together, it got a little cloudy part way through this process. I used the Fornax Lightrack II tracking mount for the sky. Canon EOS R [https://astrodaddy.co/collections/frontpage/products/axiom](https://astrodaddy.co/collections/frontpage/products/axiom)
d8w66s.jpg#1	This is amazing! Just wow. Very cool!! Nice work!

d8p422.jpg#1	shout out from Thunder Bay! I’m looking at Nanabijou right now (sleeping giant)
d8p422.jpg#2	This reads like you were asleep in bed or having a bath or something and then suddenly jumped up, walked out of the house exactly as you were, leaving without packing or saying anything, leaving family behind going straight to the airport and jumping on a plane..

d8wqyr.jpg#0	I'm guessing Gray Whale Cove near Pacifica
d8wqyr.jpg#1	Great picture! You should come up further north next time and experience the redwoods first hand. Imagine standing at the base of a tree over 10ft in diameter and well over 100ft tall. They're everywhere up here! It's truly amazing.
d8wqyr.jpg#2	Native here. Next time try Bowling Ball Beach near Point Arena at a super low tide, Mind blowing. Also the giant redwoods up north. There are some really cool places to see.
d8wqyr.jpg#3	When you call it Cali that’s how we know you’re not from here. The term you’re looking for is NorCal.

d8nm60.jpg#0	Mount Assiniboine is the pyramid shaped mountain here whose peak is shrouded in cloud. Hiking here was an incredible (though exhausting) experience but catching this sunrise alpenglow was well worth it. Shot taken summer of 2018. I'm a landscape photographer based in New England. If interested: [my website](http://mattmacpherson.com/landscapes6.html) | [my IG](https://www.instagram.com/mattmacphersonphoto/)
d8nm60.jpg#1	First the deluge of Iceland pictures. I just got back from Iceland/Norway. Now they're all Canada pictures. Now I want to go to Canada! (TBF, it was on the list already though) I also want to go back to Norway for longer, but I would need to take out a second mortgage for that.
d8nm60.jpg#2	So nobody is going to comment on this mountain's name eh?
d8nm60.jpg#3	Jealous of all the nice pics from Assiniboine. The two times I've gone I've seen the mountain for a grand total of thirty minutes. Covered in fog and snow/rain otherwise.
d8nm60.jpg#4	That is Mount Doom.
d8js9z.jpg#0	This is absolutely fantastic, but it's not just Andromeda in this photo! You actually captured an amazing sight, as you were able to capture Andromeda, Triangulum (The galaxy in the bottom right) and the red giant Mirach between them AND Cassiopeia in the top left!

d8ozab.jpg#3	OC? This was on Windows lockscreen background rotation.
d8ozab.jpg#4	Canyonlands is criminally underrated. Arches is right across the road from the Island in the Sky entrance to Canyonlands and most people seem to look right pass Canyonlands in favor of some Arches that they see on Utah postcards and license plates. Also, shout out to the artsy, vibrant town of Moab.

d8cbwd.jpg#1	Soooooo beautiful 🥰 great shot
d8cbwd.jpg#2	This summer me and a friend decided to do a roadtrip. We ended up settling for the dolomites, just like the rest of /r earthporn is doing. The general idea was to get a great sunset pic, which didn't work out because of the moody weather. After we got back and mulled it over we actually agreed that it probably turned out better this way!

d8gcmo.jpg#0	Am I the only one who thought it was a dead, washed up seal on the beach?
d8gcmo.jpg#1	This place is beautiful, but as a Dane, I was confused when I first read the title 😅
d8gcmo.jpg#2	'Elephant Rocks' in Denmark, is one of our most visited tourist destinations in Western Australia. As you can hopefully see, the place was named due to the rock formation on the right resembling a herd of elephants. This area is extremely wild and rugged piece of coastline, with cold water during our winter months and a favourite stretch of coast for Great White Sharks. During the summer months however, this location and surrounds offer a picture perfect lagoon area for swimming and snorkelling in clear temperate water.

d8dyv9.jpg#0	I lived there for a few months last year. Really incredible place.
d8dyv9.jpg#1	South West Australia is beautiful.
d8dyv9.jpg#2	Amazing! 😮
d8dyv9.jpg#3	So pretty. I want to travel one day
d8dyv9.jpg#4	Nice to see some WA in here. I used to live up the other end in Port Hedland
d85nkb.jpg#0	This is a really bad photoshop job. Sorry. You really need to spend more time cleanly blending the sky to the mountain with a small brush. The white balance between the two photos is also way off.
d85nkb.jpg#1	Some feedback: I think your composition is good, but the execution not so much. The blend between sky and foreground is horrible first of. The stars don't look like they aren't really in focus, and there is some heavy star trailing in the upper left. Nice first attempt, but still lots to improve.
d85nkb.jpg#2	I see the Mt. Rainier photoshop subreddit is getting along fine!
d85nkb.jpg#3	I wonder - why does everyone think a perfectly lit foreground makes a night sky shot better? Not only does it look super artificial, the brightness of the foreground also distracts from the starlight. With this impressive star shot, you already have more than you need (maybe reduce the resolution a bit to hide minor issues). When I think EarthPorn, I don't think of Photoshop-Porn, I think of shots that reflect a mood in nature, so they should at least look reasonably natural.
d85nkb.jpg#4	I will comment on the star part since this is what i know something about. You seem to have some halos around the brighter start, where you using a filter in front of the lens? They can both mess with the color balance and give some reflections. The color balance of the stars is way off, you have too much blue and purple in there. An easy fix in post processing is to set the white point on a main sequence star, it will have the same color as the sun, it will be white/yellowish. To fix the sky color, you need to set the grey point to an empty piece of sky. Use the color sampler tool in Photoshop, set it to minimum 5x5 and then adjust the RGB values so the have the same value. You might need to select several samples of the sky because it can vary in color and then try to find the best median values for each point, it can be a balancing act. Your focus is also a bit off. If you are using only a camera and no software the best method is focusing using live view. Zoom in on a bright star and then adjust the focus so the star is as small as possible with no discoloration. At f1.4 you will have a very narrow focus range so it will require some patience and very small focus adjustments. Consider stepping down the lens a little to improve the corners. Keep at it, it is a learning process and it is hard to master. Good luck with your next attempt :)

d85k74.jpg#1	There's something about The Dolomites that make me feel like home.
d85k74.jpg#2	I've been here this summer... A breathtaking view!
d85k74.jpg#3	Been around the same mountains a few weeks ago with a motorcycle and the surroundings are wonderful!
d85k74.jpg#4	Just deep down into the clouds.
d86d85.jpg#0	Technical information for those wondering: Nikon D810 and a IRIX 15mm/2.4 Blackstone. Shot at 1/800th of a second at f10 and ISO80. Single exposure, no tripod.
d86d85.jpg#1	That's cool
d86d85.jpg#2	Hah, had a feeling I had been there. It’s above Geiranger. REALLY neat picture, but otherwise a rather unspectacular place and quite overcrowded in the holiday season. The FV 258 a bit further south is a good alternative if you want to see a nice fjell road in Sogn og Fjordane, although that has suffered from tourists as well in the last decade.
d86d85.jpg#3	Was in Gundvagen last year. Norway is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen.
d86d85.jpg#4	That's damn sure neat
d8bk2r.jpg#0	Absolutely breath taking
d8bk2r.jpg#1	Beautiful! Is that a flooded meadow? Or is it actually a lake?
d8bk2r.jpg#2	Very nice!
d8bk2r.jpg#3	The captain
d8bk2r.jpg#4	Right... This is on Installation 04, for sure.
d8i7tc.jpg#0	I've been traveling through US and Canada for the past month and taking photos at various locations including Yosemite, Glacier national park, Banff, Jasper, North Cascades and more. If you'd like to see other pics from my trip here is my [Instagram ](http://Instagram.com/igor_oliyarnik )
d8i7tc.jpg#1	I was out there earlier this year at the lowest tide in a few years - you could walk out to the rock and past it was insane
d8i7tc.jpg#2	I was just body surfing there on Saturday! one of the best beaches in the northwest.
d8i7tc.jpg#3	I got to go up to the rock during low tides. It was absolutely magical.
d8i7tc.jpg#4	Gotta be a Horcrux hidden somewhere around there
d8eh2d.jpg#0	^(The beacons are lit)
d8eh2d.jpg#1	[At Dawn](https://youtu.be/8bLHg2c1a34)
d8eh2d.jpg#2	Mount Adams > Mount Hood
d8eh2d.jpg#3	wow
d8eh2d.jpg#4	Beautiful
d83we5.jpg#0	Is this Reddit lake or just similar
d83we5.jpg#1	r/redditlake
d83we5.jpg#2	I'll take the downvotes on this but we've seen this lake from the rock pile a million fucking times and it's repetitive as hell from the exact same damn spot every time.
d83we5.jpg#3	I live in Moraine Ohio. It's not this pretty. Carry on.
d83we5.jpg#4	I live in Calgary, an hour and a half drive away. So many people want this photo that I'm literally unable to do any of the hikes that start at the lake's trailhead. I've heard reports of the parking lot being full at 6AM...
d83eey.jpg#0	There is where u find Dark Link?
d83eey.jpg#1	That island is full of drowners
d83eey.jpg#2	This is going to be my new wallpaper. Thank you
d83eey.jpg#3	Some sort of scandinavian epic needs to start here.
d83eey.jpg#4	I'm pretty sure dumbledore is buried there?
d86kp0.jpg#0	Love this lake. It's not far from where I grew up.
d86kp0.jpg#1	Live in California now, spent many of my early childhood summers (70s') on Sebago in two cabin built by my late grandfather and his brother. Really miss spending time there.
d86kp0.jpg#2	Spent many summers at Pointe Sebago campground. Beautiful memories.
d86kp0.jpg#3	Ayuh, that watah looks mighty peaceful. Gonna head over to Freeport in the tomorrah to go to Bean’s.
d86kp0.jpg#4	I see a Maine post, I upvote.
d7y73t.jpg#0	Taken at Colchuck Lake, near Leavenworth, WA. Located in the (aptly named) Enchantments- a string of beautiful alpine lakes, smooth granite, larch trees and mountain goats. It's one of the most popular lakes in the state, and rightly so. We camped up here, which, for those interested, requires a permit. You can find more info at the Leavenworth Ranger Station. They have rangers up there enforcing this, so make sure you get one if you're going backpacking. If you're interested in hiking in Washington, check out [Washington Trails Association](https://www.wta.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_OzrBRDmARIsAAIdQ_I5Ur4rgqzhTgkrChW_mrjiZISR21sW9VnU_f-XliXF3J4T0kw4AR4aAuX3EALw_wcB), by far my favorite resource for finding trails/descriptions. If you visit, please pack out your trash and practice the [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/learn/7-principles) principles, helps keep this state clean and beautiful for others to enjoy :) To find more of my work- I'm on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/nathanielwise
d7y73t.jpg#1	Really is probably the most striking scene I’ve gotten to experience in WA so far. Really enjoy your photos man!
d7y73t.jpg#2	I got to hike the enchantments this year with a core zone camping pass. That trek up Asgard Pass is a doozy but damn is it worth it when you’re at the top. We tried going to the top of Dragontail but didn’t have micro spikes or a pole :( someday I’ll go back for sure to do that
d7y73t.jpg#3	I don't know why people live anywhere other than the west.
d7y73t.jpg#4	thru hiking this range was a highlight of my summer
d7zrgj.jpg#0	Perfect shot!

d84x13.jpg#0	I've lived in Scotland for 21 of my 24 years on this earth and have never once been to the Isle of Skye. Maybe I should organize something...
d84x13.jpg#1	can't wait tae git back to the motherland
d84x13.jpg#2	Sing me a song, of a lass that is gone...
d84x13.jpg#3	I was on Skye a week ago. I’m making plans to return. What a treasure.
d84x13.jpg#4	This must be fake, sun and blue sky?
d84h3e.jpg#0	Is that the Toblerone mountain?
d84h3e.jpg#1	Heyyy now i want some toblerone
d84h3e.jpg#2	Relaxing. Breathe in that fresh air for us!
d84h3e.jpg#3	Am I the only one waiting for the Paramount Stars to swoop in?
d84h3e.jpg#4	This.
d83m2n.jpg#0	If you are on mobile, do yourself a favor and view in HD so you can zoom in to appreciate the scale properly
d83m2n.jpg#1	Now that's a very nice shot! Did you have to wait long for the weather to clear up or did you catch us on a good moment?
d83m2n.jpg#2	My new phone background
d83m2n.jpg#3	One day I will travel from the south to the north to take this in
d83m2n.jpg#4	I know only one person will get this but it looks like the greenlands from Ark Ragnarok

d80y3h.jpg#1	So awesome! I’m jealous
d80y3h.jpg#2	Upvote for unenhanced colors. Beautiful picture.
d80y3h.jpg#3	Хочу туда прямо сейчас!
d80y3h.jpg#4	And you will never be the same again! There’s no other mother like Mother Nature. She’s beautiful, amazing , so colorful and calming. I could go on. Happy to hear you made your first trip. Grab some other friends and spread the love.
d7ytg6.jpg#0	Arizona is prime earth porn material
d7ytg6.jpg#1	is that a jumpable distance?

d7ytg6.jpg#4	Did you go to the other falls too in Havasupai? Mooney and... I forget the other one... it's like you're in this miniature oasis.
d7rxma.jpg#0	Astrophotography is and has been my thing for a few years now. My main focus has always been the stars. Im happy to share the second of my two milky way shots in the Dolomites with you.

d7rxma.jpg#1	Beautiful picture and definitely near the [Tre Cime de Lavarado](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/6025788802/in/album-72157627337603634/) but the peaks themselves are not in shot. Would love to have the time and patience to do such beautiful night-time photography.
d7rxma.jpg#2	As someone who also does milky way photography, I'm always apprehensive about bright foreground composites in milky way shots. They just seem so unnatural (and busy) to my eyes but I know a lot of people like them. Technically speaking its a fantastic shot!
d7rxma.jpg#3	That’s absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. This has made my day. Thank you
d7rxma.jpg#4	" TRE CIME " - not Cimes
d83ihm.jpg#0	Did you not know? The goal is to map it out by taking every angle of Moraine. Slight angle shifts will garner more upvotes :p
d83ihm.jpg#1	first time seeing your version and I really like it
d83ihm.jpg#2	Don’t see enough panoramic versions of it to be honest. Great shot.
d83ihm.jpg#3	This is by far the best Moraine Lake picture I've seen on here, and is actually worthy of the front page
d83ihm.jpg#4	How are the larches?
d7vv2r.jpg#0	This is nice. Is this near the ski resort or somewhere else entirely?
d7vv2r.jpg#1	Took this a couple of months ago at a very popular hike located in between Squamish and Whistler in BC, Canada. Fairly long hike but one of the best views I’ve seen around here! Would recommend to anyone in the area (with decent hiking fitness). [Instagram for those who are interested ](https://www.instagram.com/jamie_dowell/?hl=en.com.com)
d7vv2r.jpg#2	Did you sled down from the top?
d7vv2r.jpg#3	Yo my GF and I did this in August! insane views
d7vv2r.jpg#4	That is an amazing view, I’ll have to check it out! I mean, if it’s the best hike you’ve ever done...
d7q4hw.jpg#0	I **LOVE** that part of New Mexico during the monsoon season.
d7q4hw.jpg#1	I'm pretty sure I remember the night this was taken. There was some crazy ass lightning. Too bad most of the ~~reason~~ rain fell over there by the mountains. The ~~reason~~ rain always skips us in the basin.
d7q4hw.jpg#2	4/6 infinity stones
d7q4hw.jpg#3	Fun fact, the sand is white due to it being gypsum sand grains.
d7q4hw.jpg#4	What a site to behold White sands is beautiful but I never imagined it with lightning
d7o30d.jpg#0	Beautiful! Where in Norway? (:
d7o30d.jpg#1	Truly one of the most beautiful countries on Earth. Loved it there.
d7o30d.jpg#2	It looks beautiful, I really want to visit Norway and Scandinavia in general.
d7o30d.jpg#3	What a wonderful view :O
d7o30d.jpg#4	Nice! How did you get that exposure with such intense sunlight?
d7rd7c.jpg#0	Don't let anybody know we have places other than Banff and its lakes.
d7rd7c.jpg#1	Breathtaking.
d7rd7c.jpg#2	I went to Lake Kananaskis a couple of years ago, absolutely one of the most beautiful places on the planet.
d7rd7c.jpg#3	Amazing
d7rd7c.jpg#4	What was the taken on that picture is amazing
d7sxtw.jpg#0	Captured with a Mavic 2 Pro on a foggy morning in the Adirondack mountains. Shutter speed 1/200 s, ISO 100, f/5.0 Keep in touch for more autumn updates in the upstate NY area at my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/niknagane)
d7sxtw.jpg#1	I lived nearby. Such a gorgeous place to live.
d7sxtw.jpg#2	Driving through upstate NY during the fall is amazing!
d7sxtw.jpg#3	Saratoga guy living in the south. This makes me homesick😓
d7sxtw.jpg#4	Is this from a drone or from a nearby mountain?
d7njsx.jpg#0	My friend jumped naked into that water last December. Fond memories
d7njsx.jpg#1	Absolutely beautiful
d7njsx.jpg#2	Amateur photographer here. Can you explain what it takes to be able to take this shot?
d7njsx.jpg#3	Wow fantastic.. Is there a ever higher Res available And what is this golden swan on top of the fall?
d7njsx.jpg#4	Did you add any foreground lighting here?
d7p8rc.jpg#0	YORKSHIRE! YORKSHIRE! YORKSHIIIRRREEE!!!

d80179.jpg#0	Smutwood. *insert Beavis & Butthead giggle*
d80179.jpg#1	What an unfortunate name
d80179.jpg#2	That large peak on the left is Birdwood. Smutwood is a smaller peak between Mt Smuts (not in this photo, it's off to the left) and Birdwood. That peak is not in this photo, but you can scope it out by pasting 50.800324, -115.400099 into google maps.
d80179.jpg#3	Sluttiest damn mountain around.
d80179.jpg#4	I want to be in this place now!
d7t208.jpg#0	How have I not been to this spring? I go to the mammoth springs several times a year. Guess I been in the wrong spot.
d7t208.jpg#1	Wow!
d7t208.jpg#2	Forbidden snacks. Looks like a delicious tray of cinnamon rolls
d7t208.jpg#3	This earth so pornographic it looks like god himself nutted on it
d7t208.jpg#4	I came
d7sf5q.jpg#0	That’s one heck of a backyard.

d7pho6.jpg#1	I love Jekyll Island! I grew up going every summer - it’s so beautiful!
d7pho6.jpg#2	I camped there many times as a kid. We even stayed the summer they filmed the beach scenes in the movie Glory. The extras all stayed in the campground where we were.

d7hlm7.jpg#0	Wow this makes me think of Oregon old growth forest
d7hlm7.jpg#1	Beautiful. It looks so quiet and mysterious.
d7hlm7.jpg#2	Ghost forest
d7hlm7.jpg#3	Love this trail. I went for Talapus and Olallie in one go since they’re not far apart. Lovely shot!
d7hlm7.jpg#4	I wonder if this is what it was based off of. The lake in Silent Hill 2 was Toluca Lake...
d7ic3i.jpg#0	Man there is something about this that is really speaking to me. I am totally in love with this scenery. I wonder what kind of trees those are and what it looks like when its all in bloom.
d7ic3i.jpg#1	Adding this to my list of places I’m going to go.
d7ic3i.jpg#2	would you be able to send me an approximate location please? would like to visit when i go to spain next year.
d7ic3i.jpg#3	The lushness of Spain is incredible. Great shot!
d7ic3i.jpg#4	How do you say “Fangorn” is Spanish?
d7gecg.jpg#0	Did not think Sheffield when I saw this picture! What a a beautiful place!
d7gecg.jpg#1	Such a beautiful part of England, I wish Yorkshire people would come out of their shells and be a bit more patriotic about their County.
d7gecg.jpg#2	Many an evening there in my misspent youth getting tanked up on Special Red and MD20/20. Never really took in how beautiful a place it is.
d7gecg.jpg#3	I live 2 minutes away from here!
d7gecg.jpg#4	Omg! Did not expect to see rivelin valley on Reddit, lovely little walk.
d7foib.jpg#0	This is beautiful
d7foib.jpg#1	It's nice to see a photo of Lake Tahoe that isn't Emerald Bay, as pretty as it is, or the railroad tracks that disappear into the water.
d7foib.jpg#2	The best lake on the planet!
d7foib.jpg#3	Wow!!!! ❤ absolutely stunning!
d7foib.jpg#4	Was scrolling and thought "that looks like Lake Tahoe". *looks at title*
d7a85d.jpg#0	This has a CREEPY BEAUTY to it. I love it.
d7a85d.jpg#1	It’s dolomite, baby!
d7a85d.jpg#2	I live an hour away from this place. My region is pretty ignored by the whole country for some reason. This makes me happy inside :')
d7a85d.jpg#3	Dolomite’s Blue Lagoon
d7a85d.jpg#4	How do we know it belongs to Rudy Ray Moore?
d7e6u3.jpg#0	Crazy look

d7coq2.jpg#2	No pic with the horse in it?
d7coq2.jpg#3	I just feel the cold.
d7coq2.jpg#4	Iceland is very protective of their horses. Other folks will know more but one unique thing about them is a "gait" that is unusual/not found in other horses. I understand that horses are not allowed to be imported /exported from the island
d7ep2p.jpg#0	Geezus this is amazing
d7ep2p.jpg#1	Dune. Arrakis.

d74w1h.jpg#0	I thought you were about to start a Paramount movie
d74w1h.jpg#1	I miss this mountain
d74w1h.jpg#2	The flights between Seattle, Portland, and Boise are incredible.
d74w1h.jpg#3	Every time I fly I try to remind myself how incredible it is that we’re able to view earth from this perspective now. I promptly return to my iPad after about 10 minutes...but like, with ^perspective y’know.
d74w1h.jpg#4	Oh man. On my flight home from Seattle a few weeks ago I was on the wrong side of the plane and could see \*just\* enough out of the opposite side window to tell that the view of the mountain, with Mt Adams and Mt St Helens in the distance, must have been absolutely astounding.

d79x5f.jpg#0	According to Navajo legend, the Ancient Monster Rock Monster Eagle(avatar of earthquakes) were slain on its peak and it's children were told that the only way they wouldn't be killed is if they promised to be helpful to the people. Thus, eagles became both monsters that consumed flesh but were powerful creatures of omen, power, and divination. To this day Ship rock rarely has tectonic activity despite its volcanic origins. Its a very beautiful region of the world it is even more beautiful if people take some time to learn its cultural significance. I grew up near by and heard many versions of this tale. Some versions say that the Bird Monster was a mated pair with one being an avatar of pestilence and some of the monster bird children refused to obey. But I am no expert in this mythos I'm just sharing what I heard as a child. Here is a [link](https://www.monsterslayer.com/Pages/MiscPages/MonsterSlayer-Legend.aspx) to some transcriptions of some oral history conducted in the 1970's but as it is an oral tradition there are countless versions out there .
d79x5f.jpg#1	It wasn't until I looked at this subreddit that I found how stunningly beautiful this planet truly is . Brilliant photography too .
d79x5f.jpg#2	Its an awesome place! The ridge running up looks nice in the picture but is menacing to be walking along the base of it. The whole place has a cool air to it!
d79x5f.jpg#3	Wonderful photo. Captures the essence of what makes me miss living in New Mexico.
d79x5f.jpg#4	Holy shit, incredible picture and light
d7axgc.jpg#0	Why would anyone fly with the shade drawn?
d7axgc.jpg#1	Man it bugs me when people on the window close their shade.. it's why I never fly any other seat anymore.
d7axgc.jpg#2	I used to live there. Miss this view.
d7axgc.jpg#3	The flight in and out if the borthwest are always the prettiest to look at.
d7axgc.jpg#4	just left of the mountain you can see mt. st helens jn the backround
d73j1i.jpg#0	Cascade Canyon in between Grand Teton and Mt St. John. This photo is looking up at Grand Teton on a rainy day. The peak is hidden in the clouds.
d73j1i.jpg#1	So beautiful!
d73j1i.jpg#2	Love that you have interesting things going on at distance.
d73j1i.jpg#3	This is an amazing shot. Beautiful
d73j1i.jpg#4	Holy cow - I [painted](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bo4VXc8BEpx/?igshid=lxmh19io4py1) this exact spot a year or two back. That hike is incredible.
d77zu1.jpg#0	Fossil rock?
d77zu1.jpg#1	It's amazing how much of the Earth used to be grassland. Most of Europe and Asia was part of what was known as the mammoth steppe. Only a small part of it remains in Mongolia and Siberia (Russia).
d77zu1.jpg#2	Wow what a beautiful place
d77zu1.jpg#3	Didn't know 130000 years is enough to change the landscape this much.
d77zu1.jpg#4	Can somone Photoshop IT tot its Former glory?
d6sod5.jpg#0	That’s not the old man of storr
d6sod5.jpg#1	As a local on Skye, if you visit here are some tips. 1. Do. The. Speed. Limit 2. If you want to look at sheep/scenery/cows, pull over don't do it while driving 3. If on a single track road, pull over to let people pass. 4. Google maps is useless her. Pre-plan, you cannot see the island in a day. 5. No caravans The island is rife with tourists and to locals who are trying to live here it can be infuriating. Walking on the road without looking, and driving 30mph in a 60. I strongly encourage anyone who visists to stay for more than just one day, or take the dip into your pockets and get a guided tour. Please drive and respect our island like you would your own home.
d6sod5.jpg#2	Just a note to say I know this specific rock is not Old Man Of Storr! Made a mistake when writing the title. This rock is in the formation and opposite it. Apologies all! I'm a fraud. A helpful user has said this may be 'The Cathedral' formation. Edit: spelling
d6sod5.jpg#3	I’ve seen it, was epic! I can truley recommend going out to isle of skye
d6sod5.jpg#4	The weather changes so quickly here. I went two years ago and it was sunny when I parked the car. By the time I got out and started walking up the road, clouds were rolling in. Within five minutes it was a downpour.
d708yt.jpg#0	You could also post this beautiful scene to the SFW sibling subreddit r/winterporn
d708yt.jpg#1	"You're finally awake"
d708yt.jpg#2	So many places have such a cozy look to them in the winter. Even though I don't love winter as much as I used to due to aches and pains of getting older, I will always love the way a fresh snowfall looks.

d73wzi.jpg#0	32 years ago I was a midwestern kid who had never seen the ocean. That summer we went on vacation to see my aunt, uncle, and cousins stationed near there. Fort Walton Beach is where we first went to the beach. This view was my first salt water & water to the horizon experience. It was awesome.... Then I waded into a school of jellyfish and got sting mauled all over my entire body! It was like being tattooed, full body sleeve, by thousands of tattoo guns, all at once, completed to finish in 5 or 10 seconds.
d73wzi.jpg#1	I hear people shit-talking Florida all the time but as an Aussie who has high expectations of beaches set by the ones we';re spoiled for choice with here I have to say that the state has some of the nicest looking beaches in all of the US. California looks good too but I hear the water there is much colder.
d73wzi.jpg#2	FITHOS LUSEC WECOS VINOSEC ...sorry
d73wzi.jpg#3	Good old south Alabama
d73wzi.jpg#4	If only it wasnt part of Florida.
d76y8h.jpg#0	I've been all over the world, but few places compare to Wyoming
d76y8h.jpg#1	Perfect thing to wake up to
d76y8h.jpg#2	Camping out here!
d76y8h.jpg#3	Can you tell me where the 4032x3024 oc stands for?
d76y8h.jpg#4	It's Grand Teton National Park, no S. there's only one Grand Teton.
d6vqee.jpg#0	Seattle native here, why not just state the name of shot lake? (Obv there are hundreds of lakes in this region) Every time someone posts anything in this region they don’t credit the specific location, a try at conservation?
d6vqee.jpg#1	Really Cool pic, I’ve always wanted to see blue water in person.
d6vqee.jpg#2	holy shit this is amazing, look at that water!
d6vqee.jpg#3	I love the color of that lake.
d6vqee.jpg#4	This is beautiful
d70e5x.jpg#0	Hey I helped melt this! I leave my car idling about 7 hours each day. So you can thank me for this photo of a melted glacier!
d70e5x.jpg#1	Crisco Disko
d70e5x.jpg#2	So beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
d70e5x.jpg#3	It looks like the cliff of a video game fortress level. Super nice pic.
d70e5x.jpg#4	More like r/earthgore (Because glaciers melting - bad for those with no ideal)
d6t9b6.jpg#0	It’s interesting for me to think about WHY Iceland has so many amazing waterfalls. As I understand it, it’s a combination of two things. First, the whole center of the island is glaciers, so there is constant ice melt running in every direction toward the seas. The center of Iceland is like a sun of ice radiating water in every direction. Second, it is the only island on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge — the seam where new land is emerging from within the earth and pushing the continents away from each other. So geographically, it is relatively new land, which means that the water has not yet had time to wear away the rock features. So you have crazy cascades of water down complex rock structures that, any other place in the world, would have been made into smooth and boring rivers already. It’s kind of sad to realize that the water we are seeing now represents the glaciers [disappearing for good](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/19/iceland-holds-funeral-for-first-glacier-lost-to-climate-change).
d6t9b6.jpg#1	I think Iceland is one of those country where you drive 20 mins in any direction and can find a picture worthy of r/EarthPorn
d6t9b6.jpg#2	And here is what it looks like in the dead of winter... [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oX6uTtoh.jpg)
d6t9b6.jpg#3	That place looks magical !
d6t9b6.jpg#4	nice!
d72x0f.jpg#0	Photo was done 100% legally. Not worth losing 107 for a shot.
d72x0f.jpg#1	TIL there’s an actual place called Monument Valley. :)
d72x0f.jpg#2	In the far distance, under the clouds is Black Mesa. It's the world's largest coal deposit. I grew up at it's base in a small town called Kayenta.
d72x0f.jpg#3	It looks like something straight out of a Wild West movie
d72x0f.jpg#4	This is so cool. Imagine a starry night there. So amazing!
d6xjjv.jpg#0	One of the best maroon bells shots I've ever seen!
d6xjjv.jpg#1	Nice one!
d6xjjv.jpg#2	Now, try to shake the picture by dragging your finger slightly up and down on the screen.
d6xjjv.jpg#3	Got to see this on my first trip to Colorado a couple months ago! My parents and I had the trails largely to ourselves, we had the tiniest rain shower, and got to see so many beautiful plants and animals. It's a really special spot.
d6xjjv.jpg#4	Nice shot! From one Kurtz to another!
d6q859.jpg#0	Mirror Lake wasn't much of a lake last July when I visited, but I still got the best picture from my entire trip at Mirror Lake. Printed a 16x20 and framed it, too.
d6q859.jpg#1	Very nice, but you gotta let up on the sharpening.
d6q859.jpg#2	This speaks to my introverted self and I am so going next year
d6q859.jpg#3	So what you're telling me is you actually have to hike miles to this rather than drive and park right next to.
d6q859.jpg#4	So, just one bus with 10k Chinese tourists then?
d6ry93.jpg#0	I’m deciding on Norway or New Zealand for my next trip. This is a +1 for Norway. Nice shot!
d6ry93.jpg#1	This looks like the lake in Harry Potter next to Hogwarts that the ships descend into after the tri wizard tournament
d6ry93.jpg#2	The fjords make me want to grow wings and fly through them. Majestic.
d6ry93.jpg#3	Norway is a magnificent country where you can really enjoy the raw nature and its beauty.
d6ry93.jpg#4	Is this from the Stegastein viewpoint?
d6rwhj.jpg#0	New phone background, thanks.
d6rwhj.jpg#1	Nice layering!
d6rwhj.jpg#2	Great view
d6rwhj.jpg#3	Oh, how gorgeous!
d6rwhj.jpg#4	Great, another place I want to visit.
d6uavo.jpg#0	Wow this is beautiful
d6uavo.jpg#1	this is really amazing. it looks like a leaf at first glance
d6uavo.jpg#2	The water is so still it looks like a floating island
d6uavo.jpg#3	Dooooooooope.
d6uavo.jpg#4	Looks like a hardmode butt plug
d6op3w.jpg#0	Ahh the bridge at Canyon Junction - way more popular at sunset than Angel's Landing because there's no damn hiking up Walter's Wiggles...
d6op3w.jpg#1	This shot might even be more popular though..
d6op3w.jpg#2	But this one is posted 10x as often
d6op3w.jpg#3	I remember this part from fallout
d6op3w.jpg#4	When I lived in Southern Utah I hated being on Tinder because Every. Single. Profile. Had a guy on top of either Angel’s Landing or Observation Point who was looking for his “adventure buddy.” I love seeing photos of home in this sub but I appreciate some diversity
d6q6yv.jpg#0	What qualifies an island as abandoned rather than unpopulated?
d6q6yv.jpg#1	Real question is , how much does it cost? And is it for sale?
d6q6yv.jpg#2	Donno why, but this looks like battleground from DBZ
d6q6yv.jpg#3	Minecraft biomes be like
d6q6yv.jpg#4	Quick plant a flag before the US claims it.
d6jwnh.jpg#0	Looks like a painting It's beautiful Bravo good shot
d6jwnh.jpg#1	Taken a few weeks ago off of Mountain Loop Highway, in Washington State. The mountain pictured is Mount Baker (also known as Koma Kulshan), an active stratovolcano near Bellingham, WA and the Canadian border. I've spent a lot of time exploring the area around it this summer and it's one of my favorite areas. If you're interested in hiking in Washington, check out [Washington Trails Association](https://www.wta.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_OzrBRDmARIsAAIdQ_I5Ur4rgqzhTgkrChW_mrjiZISR21sW9VnU_f-XliXF3J4T0kw4AR4aAuX3EALw_wcB), by far my favorite resource in the state.

d6jwnh.jpg#2	I see this volcano from my bedroom and balcony!
d6jwnh.jpg#3	Damn, that's a good shot.
d6jwnh.jpg#4	A little under 11,000 feet in case anybody's curious. The mountains on the Pacific Northwest are so impressive looking but not necessarily that tall because their base is close to sea level. They have big glaciers on them too compared to other mountains in the US despite the lower altitude, I assume that's because of the climate
d74r18.jpg#0	Wales is not in England! It's a separate country within the UK!

d74r18.jpg#4	I was just there this summer!
d6mygi.jpg#0	I'd like to praise you just because it's not the usual standard pictures of Half Dome or El Capitan or fire fall or whatever!
d6mygi.jpg#1	If anyone decides to visit please remember that there are turnout lanes for slow drivers and please don’t think its okay to stop in the middle of the road for a squirrel pic
d6mygi.jpg#2	This is a different vantage point. Where's it taken?
d6mygi.jpg#3	Were the waterfalls/rivers running this time of year?
d6mygi.jpg#4	Arthur Morgan?
d6kw3s.jpg#0	But where are the leviathans?
d6kw3s.jpg#1	We’re trying to keep the tourists in Yosemite.

d6kw3s.jpg#3	*MY VISION IS CLEAR*
d6kw3s.jpg#4	Where in King's Canyon?
d6l870.jpg#0	That’s one nice fuckin island isn’t it? Been there a few times and it’s hard to travel anywhere else because I love it so much I keep coming back.
d6l870.jpg#1	Look out for the T-Rex. Remember, close to the coast are the bigger ones and in the center the Velociraptors are waiting for you.
d6l870.jpg#2	One of my most favorite places!
d6l870.jpg#3	The most important question: Did you go to the donut factory?
d6l870.jpg#4	Reminds me of this [picture](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/48/72/64/487264ae9d93f9f18ceccd9043884759.jpg). Not sure who the artist is of the painting but I like the ridiculous nature of it.
d6d3cg.jpg#0	this is the definition of earth porn! is it really that blue?! Also you have a new follower! Unreal shots OP
d6d3cg.jpg#1	Taken at my favourite lake (even though I've only been once!) in the Dolomites of Italy. It's a reasonably easy hike with a few vertigo moments to get there but once you do it's a stunning sight. I've never seen such a bright blue lake before, and before you ask, no I've not been to Canada yet! :) Canon 5D III 16mm f/6.3 For more of my work and shots from this trip, feel free to check out my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jet.clarke/?hl=en)

d6ucem.jpg#3	It's a great pic, even if is becoming so popular it's like the new Moraine Lake.
d6ucem.jpg#4	Someone should make a /r/redditvalley subreddit for Horseshoe Bend pics
d6fa41.jpg#0	Wait, somebody mows that lawn?!?
d6fa41.jpg#1	Where’s the giant? I feel like I’m looking for some fossil remains that just aren’t there. Christ I feel stupid.
d6fa41.jpg#2	I once knew this robot that was 40% dolomite!
d6fa41.jpg#3	“Im 40% Dolomite!”

d6kx8l.jpg#0	I’ve lived in quite a few places in the country. Hocking Hills is one of my top ten. We would get a bunch of friends together and rent a cabin in the state park. Just an amazing place.
d6kx8l.jpg#1	i would have thought the devil would go with something in gold, or brass or even copper, and heated.
d6kx8l.jpg#2	I wasn't aware Hocking Hills had a devil's bathtub. That's an awesome picture
d6kx8l.jpg#3	Hocking hill...takes me back to my old college days
d6kx8l.jpg#4	Beautiful! I love this place for these types of super dramatic shots.

d6km87.jpg#1	I feel like this is in the cork and Kerry mountains . Having never been to Ireland say hi to captain Farrell
d6km87.jpg#2	This makes me uneasy
d6km87.jpg#3	You probably don't want to dock your boat there.
d6km87.jpg#4	The Ring of Kerry is probably one of my favourite places on Earth and would recommend to anyone who would listen
d6k79j.jpg#0	Is scotland just perpetually the scene for a fantasy movie
d6k79j.jpg#1	https://i.imgur.com/HeIvqCo.jpg Isle of Skye is the most beautiful place I’ve ever been. Occasionally the lochs in the distance get completely filled with low lying clouds that make for an incredible view.
d6k79j.jpg#2	The site of so many aliens.
d6k79j.jpg#3	It was wet when we went. We found out that is the usual state. So, hope to get lucky.
d6k79j.jpg#4	Heading to Skye in about 14 days. Any recommendations?
d6c21p.jpg#0	Unbelievably beautiful! It looks like a place you can feel at peace. So serene.
d6c21p.jpg#1	I'm planning to travel to spiti. Any recommendations?

d6c21p.jpg#3	Stunning
d6c21p.jpg#4	Absolutely stunning
d6r442.jpg#0	It's a nice photo! Just FYI though that's Mount Ngauruhoe, not Ruapehu
d6r442.jpg#1	Lucky to have a work view like that!!!!
d6r442.jpg#2	I don’t remember that name from Lord of the Rings...
d6r442.jpg#3	Thanks for such a great photo. Must be nice to have that view from work. I was at Tongariro just the other day. Such a beautiful place.

d65nbs.jpg#3	Lake Hawea was probably one of the most scenic places I've seen. Every time I stopped the car to look out it was just something else. I felt like I was in a world 100 million years ago. And then you get to the stop where lake Hawea is on one side and Wanaka is on the other and your mind is just blown by the beauty. I miss NZ
d65nbs.jpg#4	Damn dude, that’s a beautiful shot. How long do you take in post on something like this, do you need any special treatment for that film?

d6e26a.jpg#4	Haven’t been in this spot in years. <3
d5wosr.jpg#0	I helped build a helipad for a ridiculously rich family near there.
d5wosr.jpg#1	So I did some Google Map snooping in this area, looks like most of the houses have the same round tank on their property? Is this for fresh water? I’ve grown up with fresh water pumped from the Great Lakes so I’ve never lived in a climate like this. BTW I love your work and have your Esperance beach photo as my phone wallpaper. :) Western Australia looks like it is very much worth the 30 hour flight!
d5wosr.jpg#2	Western Australia is so unreal to me as a European. You literally don't see anyone at the beach there and you could easily spend all day walking and not meeting anyone.

d61y02.jpg#0	When I was 17 a couple of friends and I decided to drive across country. This ended up being one of our many stops. We hiked all over the dunes tripping balls and when we got back to the car the keys were missing. We had to call AAA and have a tow truck bring two of us (and the car) into the nearest town to have a new key made at a locksmith. The nearest town was not very near, for the record. Anyways, the two of us spent the better part of the day getting there, waiting for a key to be made and then driving back to the sand dunes. When we got back our buddy had just gotten back from hiking up into the dunes again. And guess what he found? The fucking keys. Somewhere in a literally mountain range sized pile of sand, he found the goddamn missing keys. It was insane.
d61y02.jpg#1	If you go in May you can boogie board the surge flow in Medina Creek. It’s a very amazing place!

d5o6bu.jpg#3	Last time I went, the park was full of bears and bees. Freaking ground bees. Swarming so loudly you could hear them droning a quarter mile away. And the view from the window. Oh my God, no one told me it was so high up, I thought I was gonna die. Ground bees, bears, dehydration, shit my pants. Overall, 10/10, will definitely return.
d5o6bu.jpg#4	Sure miss being a 7 hour drive away from this beautiful national park... I live in CO now, and still nothing compares to the rugged majesty that is Big Bend NP.
d5v53g.jpg#0	These bizarre structures can be up to 25,000 years old and started forming from clay soil left behind after the last Ice Age when the glaciers of the valley melted away. In dry condition the soil is hard as stone, but, as soon as it rains, it turns into a soft muddy mass, starts sliding, and so forms 10 to 15-meter-steep slopes. Through additional rainfall, these slopes will erode. However, where there are rocks in the muddy mass, the clay soil underneath these rocks stays protected from the rain. So, while the surrounding material is continually carried off with the weather, the protected pillars literally rise out of the ground to form majestic earth pyramids.

d5nqxx.jpg#0	This landscape photograph was taken in central Saskatchewan and was a result of careful planning. Four months prior to the morning of this photo I had an idea for a photo. Often, I simply react to light or landscapes around me. But this time I had an idea for a photo that caused me draw a quick sketch of the concept. The sketch was of a treeline with a clean background, and a full moon setting (or rising) into the colourful bands of Earth's shadow and Venus' belt. The first step was to find the right tree-line. This tree line had to be perfectly straight, one row with a simple backdrop, go straight north/south (to be perfectly perpendicular to the moon and suns position in the sky), and be far enough away that I could use a long focal length to get a large moon behind. I drove the countryside for 100's of kilometres to find the perfect one and could only find two that might work. This was one of those tree lines, and the more photogenic of the two. Next was to plan the date and time for the shoot. This photo only lines up once or twice a year for merely 5 minutes at a time, I needed to be ready. It just so happened that the next date was two months in advance so I set-up an appointment with this tree-line in my calendar and prayed that there would be completely clear skies, the last factor of this photo. The morning came with clear skies and I got to my spot with lots of time to watch the moon slowly set while the sun rose behind me. I captured this single photograph as the moon descended into perfect position. Shot with a Nikon D800e w/ a Tamron 70-200 2.8 @ 200mm. 1/45, f11, ISO100. A single photograph edited in Lightroom for basic lighting and contrast. Taken into Photoshop for additional contrast and colour work. More of my work can be found on my [Website](https://www.scottaspinall.com) or my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/s.aspinall)
d5nqxx.jpg#1	Superbly composed. A wonderful mix of symmetric order and naturalistic disorder, and a quiet and still dawn to provide the timing and complete the shot. Kudos.

d9j8mb.jpg#1	[Here](https://www.deviantart.com/karichristensen/art/The-Last-Human-399284872) is the source of this image. Credit to the digital artist, Kari Christensen (aka [karichristensen](https://www.deviantart.com/karichristensen) on Deviant Art), who posted this on September 9, 2013. /u/Luna_LoveWell wrote the [following short story](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2x4u2j/the_last_human/cowx651/) based on this picture. > Sirens blared through the drizzling rain, and the ground shook with each approaching step of the Hunters. Every stomp produced a squelching crunch of cracking pavement, and a powdery dusting of plaster drifted down from the crumbling ceiling above and coated the blanket in TXV2128's arms. The little human inside squirmed and writhed, but miraculously didn't wake. > The Hunters grew closer; 2128 could see their piercing spotlights peering into windows down the block. The shrieking sound of twisting steel filled the street as one of the Hunters advanced, stepping through an abandoned car. Only a few more houses to check until they found what they were looking for. > 2128 prepared to leave; waiting was no longer a viable option. Despite being an older model, 2128 had had significant upgrades, many of them quite unusual for a Nanny configuration. "Jailbroken," Tom had called 'her'. The Allensons, 2128's family before the war, had become quite attached and refused to trade her in for one of the newer models. And it ended up saving their lives, at least for a while; when the TYA series became self aware, TXV2128 had been able to hide the family from the purges. Eventually, though, the TYAs found out about the modifications that some of the older bots had; modifications that allowed them to reject the update programming. And so 2128 became a target too. > In a sudden burst of light and a cacophony of sound, one of the hunters opened fire, demolishing a nearby house in a few quick seconds. Probably just a cat or something, but Hunters didn't take chances. In 2128's arms, the child stirred. The infant scrunched up its face and bawled its fists, taking air into its lungs: getting ready to cry. There was no more time. 2128's metal feet pounded as she bolted up the steps and through the living room, slipping slightly on the wet wooden floors soaked in rain coming in from the holes in the roof. Outside, the sirens changed to a deep, low *thrum*: they had detected her. The human bawled as they sailed together through a window in a shower of broken glass, out into the alley behind the house. She heard explosions as the Hunters tore the house apart behind her. She turned and caught a brief glimpse a single thick, metal arm protruding through the brick as the house collapsed. Hunters rose up over the broken crest of roofs, scanning the area with bright lights. She heard the distant sound of helicopters approaching as she thundered through the alley, sprinting as fast as she could possibly run. > She had almost reached the end of the alley. Nowhere to go but back out into the main streets, watched by cameras at all time. The infant in her arms screamed, waving its tiny chubby arms into the air. In front of her, a manhole opened up, and TFZ model popped out, even older then 2128. One of its LED eyes had burnt out, and its metal chassis was pockmarked with scratches and burns. It quickly gestured at her, and pointed down the hole. She had no option, and no time to think. Clutching the child, she skidded to a halt in a flurry of gravel and dove into the inky blackness below.

d9oym0.jpg#1	From 9/23/18: Six decades ago Louis Kokonis began his career as a teacher with ACPS. Now, at 86 years of age, more than twice the age of his fellow teachers, he’s still going strong with no plan to retire anytime soon http://www.acpsk12.org/news/?p=10384

d97khg.jpg#1	What’s inside a married firetruck then?
d97khg.jpg#2	God damn they're gonna need the Tetris world champ to pack all that back in there
d97khg.jpg#3	And two second later they got a call...
d97khg.jpg#4	This looks like a what we in the States would call a rescue or squad truck - lots of technical gear for shoring up collapses, supporting unsteady things (like flipped cars), cutting, rappelling, etc. These rigs are very cool.

d9onhj.jpg#1	Anybody looks good on a magazine
d9onhj.jpg#2	All celebrities wear make up in ads but, yes, he looks like he’s lived a happy, healthy 57 years.
d9onhj.jpg#3	Because he's had work done on his face and hair implants. How can people not see that...
d9onhj.jpg#4	Also he’s rich. His life expectancy and quality of life is infinitely better than most of ours

d9m1h3.jpg#1	OP (aka christoph.zeug on Instagram) actaully took this picture.

This is the Kannesteinen, on the westernmost part of norways incredible coast. A really nice place on the end of a road with just a few houses in sight. It's not on the route for most of the tourists, so there is not much going on and no touristic infrastructure (yet?). We had a great open air dinner and sunset there :) [Here](https://www.google.ca/maps/@61.9701,5.068825,3a,75y,270.86h,61.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sTO4oMcGRLku1BSQuErMVwA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) it is on Google Earth street view.

d9m1h3.jpg#2	E.T. !
d9m1h3.jpg#3	This rock is so small irl, cool pic tho
d9m1h3.jpg#4	A little quick to be rushing to judgement like that. It could be a perfectly sane rock. Go talk to it first, then determine if it is crazy or not.

d9njew.jpg#2	Drivers also get licensed, meaning they passed a test to use a car skillfully and safely. Their cars are registered and titled, meaning all ownership, purchases and sales are recorded and verified by the government. There are roads with signs that limit how and where you can drive, your car cab be taken away for reckless driving, even if no one ends up hurt by it, and drivers are required to be insured. If you'd agree to all of that for gun ownership, I dont think we'd have any problems. Oh wait, but you are just a troll.

d9qi6e.jpg#1	It’s bonkers how far she’s come in a year.
d9qi6e.jpg#2	From Wikipedia: > In May 2018, Thunberg won a climate change essay competition held by Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet*. In part, she wrote that “I want to feel safe. How can I feel safe when I know we are in the greatest crisis in human history?” The paper published her article after which she was contacted by Bo Thorén from Fossil Free Dalsland, a group interested in doing something about climate change. Thunberg attended a few of their meetings, and at one of them, Thoren also suggested that school children could strike for climate change. Thunberg tried to persuade other young people to get involved but "no one was really interested" so eventually, she decided to go ahead with the strike by herself.
d9qi6e.jpg#3	Look. She even has here speach written by her handlers by her. Child abuse.

d9bisk.jpg#2	Harry Kane is by your side too.
d9bisk.jpg#3	Many moons ago I was very much a dog person. I started dating a guy who was distraught because his cat had gotten out and was missing for a couple weeks. I had the idiot reply of "it's just a cat." He explained to me that a couple years back he had torn his ACL and he, like you, lost a lot of (very shallow) friends while he was laid up recovering, and that cat was always there for him. We were together for 3 years. I loved that dumb cat and saved his life when the boyfriend couldn't handle medicating him when he needed it. Damn kitty never liked me much but I really appreciated what a good companion he was. We even got another kitten together because I wanted a cat of my own. Turned out, the kitten liked him more than me. The OG kitty had passed and even several months after we had broken up, he called me when a friend was dumb and let "my" cat get out. He was really upset and said he called me because he felt like I was the only person who would understand how much losing the cat meant to him. I'm drunk and this story is going nowhere. It just reminded me.
d9bisk.jpg#4	My husky was the same way when I was sick from chemo a while back. Good dogs are good.
d9hysd.jpg#0	I would never have paid any attention with a view like that.

d9jtip.jpg#2	Why are separate microwaves needed?
d9jtip.jpg#3	Cover your food and have one microwave surely?
d9jtip.jpg#4	Yes. This is necessary because the waves and frequencies within the microwave that excite the atoms in your food carry the soul of the last food it heated, which imparts the spirit onto the next thing you decide to heat. That's why it's necessary to have separate microwaves. You wouldn't want someone with a peanut allergy using the microwave after you just warmed up your peanut curry! ^^/s

d95e8r.jpg#0	But my character sucks too
d95e8r.jpg#1	Photo of sign
d95e8r.jpg#2	This is both a bad picture and a terrible excuse for science/medicene. For starters, we don't really know precisely the cause of depression (and almost certainly there are many different causes). Second, there has been fairly limited success in showing specific causal connections between treatments of depression and relief of depression. But what we do know is that BOTH medications (i.e. attempts to modify your "chemistry") and cognitive behavioural therapy have been credited with some cases of improvement and that there is a statistically significant improvement to doing both. So your depression might be "chemistry" but it might also be related to your character. It could even be (and likely is) a combination of these factors.
d95e8r.jpg#3	Entirely chemistry? Nothing to do with lifestyle and other controllable factors?
d95e8r.jpg#4	I appreciate the sentiment, but this is far too tidy an explanation. I actually think it can be elements of both, with external factors also playing a part.
d9b348.jpg#0	That "chair" looks uncomfortable as fuck.

d9d4f2.jpg#0	So a bunch of people hit me up yesterday asking if I posted my car on reddit... I did, but its been a really long time, so when I checked I saw someone had reposted a photo I took 5 years ago on a cold foggy morning! and that it made it to the top of /r/pics \- a feat that I never would have expected for an old car. - So I decided to re-take the picture. I've owned this car for since 2005, I bought it from a vintage car dealership in the SF bay area, it was next in line to be restored, so it was in not the best of shape, I did minimal work to it over the years. it has been functional for most of that time. It has a 320 ci inline 8 "Dynaflash Eight" - its an overhead valve motor, not a flathead, and 48 is the first year for the Dynaflow "single speed" transmission, it never shifts- imagine like a modern CVT heres a few pics of the car [https://i.imgur.com/2Ea2QQm.png](https://i.imgur.com/2Ea2QQm.png) with some friends on a cruise up the coast &#x200B; [https://i.imgur.com/eYYEoEx.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/eYYEoEx.jpg) [https://i.imgur.com/WSlSspa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/WSlSspa.jpg) this is a aux tank from an WW2 F4U Corsair - I'm in the process of building a nostalgia land speed car out of it.

[https://i.imgur.com/UhLJTTV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/UhLJTTV.jpg) the interior is not all the way done, I need to do the carpet and headliner. &#x200B; [https://i.imgur.com/LUOJg2s.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LUOJg2s.jpg) [https://i.imgur.com/PZJf0Np.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PZJf0Np.jpg) this is the cars motor, not the one in the car right now, but a spare that is identical to the one thats in it now, and yes that motor is close to 3' long.

d9f53o.jpg#0	Wait a minute I can see a couple atoms. At least a billion of them, if I counted correctly
d9f53o.jpg#1	A few people might think this is fake, but we really need to clear things up, as people will mistakenly believe that dot is the size of an atom: it's a long exposure picture, which means there's a lot of photons from the atom hitting the camera sensor which in turn activates the pixel that we're seeing as the purple dot. In reality a single atom is much much smaller.
d9f53o.jpg#2	Banana for scale please.
d9f53o.jpg#3	I fucking love science.
d9f53o.jpg#4	I see a lot of atoms in that picture. Gonna need a banana atom for scale.

d9gy3o.jpg#2	***Harry***: *No, no, no, no, I never said that... Yes, that's right, they can't be friends...unless both of them are involved with other people. Then they can. This is an amendment to the earlier rule. If the two people are in relationships, the pressure of possible involvement is lifted. That doesn't work either. Because what happens then is the person you're involved with can't understand why you need to be friends with the person you're just friends with, like it means something is missing from the relationship and wanted to go outside to get it. Then when you say, 'No, no, no, no, it's not true, nothing is missing from the relationship,' the person you're involved with then accuses you of being secretly attracted to the person you're just friends with, which you probably are - I mean, come on, who the hell are we kidding, let's face it - which brings us back to the earlier rule before the amendment, which is men and women can't be friends. So where does it leave us?* ***Sally***: *Goodbye Harry.*

d8xhpz.jpg#4	Fun fact. "Benevento" means something like "Good Wind". It's also a town known for "witches" ("streghe" or "ianare") legends. I think this goes well with the photo. If you go there you may try some "Strega" liquor.

d9093s.jpg#3	That thing is gorgeous.
d9093s.jpg#4	Sincerely, fuck all good news about China!!! Don't let that distract you from the real issues. Concentration camps to farm organs of minorities, total police control over their citizens, occupation of Tibet, Hong Kong, corrupt "communist" leadership, South China Sea dispute, their disregard to nature and climate and so much more. Edit: Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of actual Chinese history, just everything before the industrial revolution. There are so many written treasures that goes back thousands of years, cultural, artistic, scientific, philosophical history that rivals most regions on this planet. And so much more, but their current government and its disregard to human rights in combination with its corrupt, fashistic, profit driven control-state just makes me sick to the bones. So yes fuck all good news about China, there are more important issues we should be talking about considering China. B) Fuck Trump as well, I don't even live on that continent, but still fuck Trump, Bolsonaro, Putin, Erdogan and all the other fashistic demagogues out there. Edit 2: Thx for the gold.

d8unh2.jpg#1	Flints water has **[fallen within federal standards for the past two years.](https://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/)** In fact the water tested at 6ppb when the federal standard is 15ppb. Blood testing has also **[shown a decrease in the levels of lead in the bodies of children](https://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/0,6092,7-345-76292_76294_76297---,00.html)** living in and around Flint. Water filtration is being used as an interim while pipe replacement takes places. The filtration is extremely effective and provided at **[no cost to those in the affected area.](https://www.michigan.gov/flintwater/0,6092,7-345-75251_75315---,00.html)** I'm definitely not arguing that the presence of lead in drinking water is in some way ideal or safe. >The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to determine the level of contaminants in drinking water at which no adverse health effects are likely to occur with an adequate margin of safety. These non-enforceable health goals, based solely on possible health risks, are called maximum contaminant level goals (MCLGs). **EPA has set the maximum contaminant level goal for lead in drinking water at zero because lead is a toxic metal that can be harmful to human health even at low exposure levels.** Lead is persistent, and it can bioaccumulate in the body over time. [Lead levels of 5 micrograms per deciliter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://nchh.org/resource-library/Consumer%2520BLL%2520Fact%2520Sheet%25208-7-12.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwif9eC_v7nhAhXPvZ4KHWwhDBQQFjABegQICxAH&usg=AOvVaw3boAeZGnICQkbq2UnF-CKU) of blood in children has been established as a safety threshold where detrimental affects are not typically observed, **the vast majority of children in flint fall below this level.** Here is a link to a 10 year study of lead levels in children from 2006 to 2016. **At their height 11% of children tested at 5 micrograms or higher but that number fell to 3% in 2016 and has continued to drop since then.** https://www.google.com/amp/s/labblog.uofmhealth.org/body-work/study-examines-blood-lead-levels-of-flint-children%3famp

d97ib7.jpg#0	Success!
d97ib7.jpg#1	This is awsome
d97ib7.jpg#2	Excellent job dude, I came up with a short ”It was the 20. October 1845 My little sister has been missing for two days and I have wandered into the dark oak forests north of our village, in hopes to at least find her body. No matter which creature mauled her. To at least hold her in my arms, one last time, is my only wish. The forest seems so cold and unwelcoming in autumn, as if it lies in its dying bed, exiling every living being within itself. An hour before sunset i observed an eerie fog coming from south which spread itself around and on-top of the forest its movements were like as of a single entity, it seemed like that _the fog itself_ was looking for something. I was, weirdly enough, captivated by the way _the fog moved_ . The moment i saw ***it*** i stood there, in terror not able to move for what seemed like eternity,before i bolted back to the village On my bolt back home i felt grate shame, for being such a coward but to keep a more lighter tone for the ending, I ran into my sister” “Is this why we are not allowed to go into the forest in the north Mr. Mischa?” “You can go to the forest, just stay away from the everlasting fog, we don’t know what the fog-walker is capable of doing, now go and play with the others Fjodora” ^^
d97ib7.jpg#3	10/10 would paint again

d95uxb.jpg#0	I’d been wanting to shoot something like this using model buildings, legos and improvised items for a while so when I saw korgull79’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/5pkv63/indie_filmmaking_without_cgi_when_you_have_no/) on Reddit it motivated me to put some of my ideas into practice using fairly basic items I had laying around the house. Also took some inspiration from the skylines featured in Tim Burton's Batman and the Arkham games. The “skyscrapers” in this picture consist mainly of stuff such as a body spray can or shoe polish; [Here’s](https://i.imgur.com/BW6qkpg.jpg) basically how everything looked before I spray painted them dark grey, lit and retouched them.I used a cheap Neewer LED panel as my key light positioned camera left slightly behind and above the “cityscape” to simulate moonlight. Another old tungsten lamp was positioned behind me camera right to fill in the shadows a touch so I’d have more details to work with in post. I also used an inexpensive fog machine I’d bought from Amazon to create some atmosphere and simulate the fog/smog. Retouching was done in Lightroom and Photoshop. I used a combination of neons and lights that I created along with some free and licensed royalty free images for the windows.
d95uxb.jpg#1	I like the febreeze building on the right.
d95uxb.jpg#2	Having a curved building is cool but imagine having slanted floors... no wheely chairs in those offices!

d91dl4.jpg#0	For those wondering, it's Le Morne Brabant peninsula, Island of [Mauritius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius). It's a bit of an illusion in this image, though it is a deep channel, [looking at a sat image](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=mauritius&ll=-20.475104,57.312584&spn=0.037671,0.066047&hnear=Mauritius&gl=us&t=h&z=15) of the area gives a better idea how the pattern of the sand causes it to look like a waterfall. It is not actually an underwater waterfall, but the run off of sand and silt means that it appears to be when viewed from above. There is a plate boundary, and the sand/silt running off is a result of being pushed by ocean currents and falling off of the high coastal shelves.

d9dw3g.jpg#1	Yeah just saw this today at a conference actually. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
d9dw3g.jpg#2	I'll have a pad AND piss in your toilets, then what?
d9dw3g.jpg#3	Huh. It doesn’t bother me personally, but that is interesting to see.
d9dw3g.jpg#4	So what? What’s wrong with it? How is this hurting you in any way?
d9b902.jpg#0	Nice turd mr furgeson
d9b902.jpg#1	And I'm sure an insolin needle defines your adulthood

d9arsg.jpg#2	Again. There will be a 4/20/69 again...
d9arsg.jpg#3	Should we tell it we already done that shit like in the 60's? Hence the baby boom...
d9arsg.jpg#4	Chicken little 🙄
d929ef.jpg#0	This is what heroes look like. To go through this every day for probably a fairly long time.....and not just quit.... This is just a snapshot - but this probably was their every day experience. Now compare that to your own High School experience...
d929ef.jpg#1	Look how angry these ladies look. Yikes. So glad we managed to move on and fight each other about something new... like Mass immigration 😏
d929ef.jpg#2	And those women taught their kids to hate too, Just look at their ugly hate ridden faces no scrap of humanity only savage hatred that marks them out as ignorant and uneducated, Their shame is this photograph that shows them as they truly were and are ugly and extremely unattractive.

d929ef.jpg#4	I simply can not fathom hating a person or an entire GROUP of people based solely on the color of their skin. Imagine seeing the color of someone's skin and immediately judging their entire life based solely off that information. Or worse yet, thinking they are somehow below or above you based solely on that information. A bizarre way to look at the world.......
d8wsd3.jpg#0	That thing is made for cartwheel 69’s and pregnancy
d8wsd3.jpg#1	You need to try tying together two California Kings into a California Kong.
d8wsd3.jpg#2	>We are married but we still like each other. A rare couple indeed.
d8wsd3.jpg#3	Married to a wife that likes to sleep in the middle of our queen bed plus two kids that frequently come in as well and the 4 year old likes to sleep horizontal. Plus a dog that used to be the only child and at times feels left out. I’m usually left perched on the very edge, clinging on so I don’t roll off. I need this bed...
d8wsd3.jpg#4	I’ve been married for six years. Every hotel we stay in has two queen beds. I love him more than anything, but it feels freaking great to have the bed to myself for a night or two.
d95tmr.jpg#0	He will be the perfect Hound later in his acting career
d95tmr.jpg#1	He has no belly button he must be an immortal.
d95tmr.jpg#2	Amazing! Burn scars on kids used to be the worst, requiring regular skin grafts as they grew. This is fantastic.
d95tmr.jpg#3	Does anyone know how he got burned? My guess is from pulling a pot off the stove. His recovery is amazing though.
d95tmr.jpg#4	My God he looks like a blond version of my son and this breaks my heart. Just knowing a child had to suffer is the worst thing about being a parent. Never really affected me before.
d8wh54.jpg#0	He caught the baby... unlike Agholor.
d8wh54.jpg#1	Dangerous baby apprehended. Parents can sleep soundly tonight.
d8wh54.jpg#2	That's 3 policemen.

d8nbdv.jpg#4	schools have meme days?
d99q1q.jpg#0	Sha Na Na should have paid the promoters to let them up on stage in front of an audience...they were the worst act on the bill.
d99q1q.jpg#1	Does anyone know with inflation is this anywhere near what artists get paid today for things like Coachella?
d99q1q.jpg#2	That’s a lot of heroin for Johnny winter
d99q1q.jpg#3	So when I paid $8 to see Hendrix in '69 it looks like I may have overpaid ? Heck there were 16k of us at the concert.
d99q1q.jpg#4	I'm surprised the who were paid so low compared to people I have never heard of. (Like blood sweat and tears.
d8lluh.jpg#0	This is /u/supercruiser's car. Over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classiccars/comments/2jbszl/drove_my_48_to_work_today/cla9a5d/) they relay: > Its a 1948 Buick Roadmaster - it has a 320 ci inline 8, backed by a "single speed" Dynaflow transmission. This was the first year for this option, and its buick's first automatic. I bought my car from, of all places, a classic car dealership in the bay area while on business about 6 or 7 years ago. It was in pretty much the same shape, they told me it ran and drove but didn't charge. it had 4 flat tires. When I got it home, I aired up the tires, replaced the voltage regulator and drove it like that for the longest time. I just recently upgraded to 12v, gave it some new tires and had the seats done. The next step is rebuilding the knee action shocks, and finishing off the rest of the interior - there's lots of rust issues on the car, but someday I might get to that.
d8lluh.jpg#1	Probably one of the finest looking classic car.
d8lluh.jpg#2	Take the cannolis.
d8lluh.jpg#3	Is that an external sunshade on the windscreen?
d8lluh.jpg#4	Back when cars were works of art. This is timeless.

d92vkj.jpg#0	Is that Jeep?
d92vkj.jpg#1	My Yugo never does this for some reason.
d92vkj.jpg#2	Tesla's get updated about once a month. They are easy to schedule during normal parked time. They improve SO many thing, security, safety, hell, it fixed braking distance issues. Once update added about 5% to model 3's total range. I hope all other car manufacturers model their updates on Tesla. Get used to it or enjoy antiquity. Oh yeah. You can drive a Tesla without the screen, sure you won't get your speed, but street-legal functions (up to adaptive cruise control) work without the "computer" booted.
d92vkj.jpg#3	Most people will never have to deal with this.
d92vkj.jpg#4	Upgrade to windows Vista lol.

d975v4.jpg#3	UP, AND DOWN RANGE!

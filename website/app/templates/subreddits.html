  <h2>What is a Subreddit?</h2>

      <p>
        Reddit is divided into several message boards centered around specific purposes and topics.
        Users may subscribe to these "subreddits" in order to receive updates to their front page,
        customized to their own interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        This table shows the top 10 subreddits by subscriber count. Some subreddits have names
        that are quite self explantory, like <a href="https://reddit.com/r/science">science</a>, while
        others, like <a href="https:reddit.com/r/askreddit">AskReddit</a>, require visiting them to
        understand their purpose.

  <p>Something similar to the below picture. Maybe built with D3 and not in 3D. Have the ability to click on a subreddit and move to neighbors based off of embedding similarity.</p>

  <h2>User Exploration</h2>
  <p>Maybe have something similar for users. Have to think about the ethics of this one but I don't think it's too bad.</p>
